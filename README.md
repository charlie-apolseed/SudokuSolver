# SudokuSolver
### Solves sudoku puzzles!

In this project, I developed a java program that used a stack-backed brute force approach to solving sudoku puzzles. 

The functionality of the program lies in the three classes SudokuMove, SudokuPuzzle, and SudokuSolver. To test the program, run SudokuTest and input a valid file. Examples of suitable file formats are provided (s1-4.txt).
